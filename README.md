# Internshala

Internshala is India's no.1 internship and training platform with 40000+ paid internships in Engineering, MBA, media, law, arts, and other streams.
                                    
We tried to clone the Internshala website from the scratch. For this, We have used the HTML, CSS and  JavaScript.

# Appendix

We  implemented some functionalities like image Carousel, Forms, Drop-down
menu ,hover, etc.

  
## How to use

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Neha-081/First_Project.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash

Our main Page(landing page) of this website is named
 as index.html. So, to view the project website on 
 browser you have to run that landing page.
